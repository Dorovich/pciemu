##### SHARING A FOLDER BETWEEN HOST AND GUEST #####

Just a quick tutorial for sharing folders.
This has already been done for the repository directory (/hostdir directory inside guest)

----
In host:
Add option to command line:

-virtfs local,path=/path/to/host/folder/ host,security_model=mapped,mount_tag=hostdir &

--------
In guest:

Login as root and add same groups as in host for codespaces user.

Later, add to /etc/fstab/

hostdir /path/to/guest/folder 9p _netdev,trans=virtio,version=9p2000.u,msize=104857600 0 0
